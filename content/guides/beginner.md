# Beginner's Guide

In this article we will focus on the basic gameplay mechanics and which units you should unlock first to achieve fast progress which hopefully will result in a much smoother gaming experience.

## Hero Attributes

This is a basic attribute skill guideline. It should provide you a good enough starting point to skill your character. There might be some exotic ways to skill your main weapon class, but this should be a good basis. You should avoid using the automatic assignment of attribute points provided by the game.

| Weapon Class | Main Attribute     | Secondary Attribute | Comment                                                                                   |
|--------------|------------------- |-------------------- |-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Spear        | Agility            | (Strength)          | I had the best Spear experience with full Agi                                             |
| Short Bow    | Agility            | -                   | -                                                                                         |
| Long Bow     | Agility            | -                   | -                                                                                         |
| Dual Blade   | Strength           | -                   | You are a glass cannon. Full DMG is a must!                                               |
| Nodachi      | Strength           | -                   | -                                                                                         |
| Short Sword  | Strength           | Defense             | 2/3 Strength and 1/3 Defense is my personal sweet spot                                    |
| Poleaxe      | Strength           | Defense             | -                                                                                         |
| Maul         | Defense            | Strength            | You already make tons of blunt damage, so you should focus putting more points in Defense |
| Musket       | Strength / Agility | -                   | Strength Musket for max bomb damage, Agility for PVP (piercing damage)                    |
