# Beginner's Guide

In this article we will focus on the basic gameplay mechanics and which units you should unlock first to achieve fast progress which hopefully will result in a much smoother gaming experience.

## Hero Attributes

This is a basic attribute skill guideline. It should provide you a good enough starting point to skill your character. There might be some exotic ways to skill your main weapon class, but this should be a good basis. You should avoid using the automatic assignment of attribute points provided by the game.

| Weapon Class | Main Attribute     | Secondary Attribute | Comment                                                                                   |
|--------------|------------------- |-------------------- |-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Spear        | Agility            | (Strength)          | I had the best Spear experience with full Agi                                             |
| Short Bow    | Agility            | -                   | -                                                                                         |
| Long Bow     | Agility            | -                   | -                                                                                         |
| Dual Blade   | Strength           | -                   | You are a glass cannon. Full DMG is a must!                                               |
| Nodachi      | Strength           | -                   | -                                                                                         |
| Short Sword  | Strength           | Defense             | 2/3 Strength and 1/3 Defense is my personal sweet spot                                    |
| Poleaxe      | Strength           | Defense             | -                                                                                         |
| Maul         | Defense            | Strength            | You already make tons of blunt damage, so you should focus putting more points in Defense |
| Musket       | Strength / Agility | -                   | Strength Musket for max bomb damage, Agility for PVP (piercing damage)                    |

## Quests

There are a lot of quests you can do in Conqueror's Blade: Dailies, Weeklies and Fief quests. Here's a short introduction.

### Daily Quests

You can accept these quests in every city or village and complete them on a daily basis. The most important daily quests are the 1 win, 3 and 5 Battles quests: they give you honour to unlock units and Requisition Orders to farm resources in the open world. When you are higher than level 60 you should just focus on these 3 dailies, below you can also fulfill the others to gain hero experience.

### Weekly Quests

There are a bunch of weekly quests you can complete. The more you complete, the more treasures and vault keys you unlock (as long as you have a premium account). Besides the 3, 6 and 9 wins in field battles and sieges, also the rebel camp and expedition weeklies are important. Rebel camp weeklies give you honour while the expedition weeklies will result in a bunch of silver.

### Fief Quests

In all fiefs on the open world map you can fulfill certain fief quests. They have different levels (up to 5 stars), and with every star more you will get more honour for your units and reputation for your house. If you are in a house (guild) and complete these quests in a city your house holds, you will even receive a 50% bonus on these rewards. Theres a maximum of 20 fief quests per week, which you can fulfill.
