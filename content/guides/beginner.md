# Beginner's Guide

In this article we will focus on the basic gameplay mechanics, which units you should unlock first for fast progress to have a smoother gaming experience.

## Hero Attributes

This is a raw attribute skill guideline. It should provide you a good enough starting point to skill your character. There might be some exotic ways to skill your main weapon class, but this should be a good basis.

| Weapon Class | Main Attribute      | Secondary Attribute | Comment                                                                                  |
|--------------|---------------------|-------------------- |------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Spear        | Agility             | (Strength)          | I had the best Spear experience with full Agi                                            |
| Short Bow    | Agility             | -                   |                                                                                          |
| Long Bow     | Agility             | -                   |                                                                                          |
| Dual Blade   | Strength            | -                   | You are a glass cannon. Full DMG is a must!                                              |
| Nodachi      | Strength            | -                   |                                                                                          |
| Short Sword  | Strength            | Defense             | The weight of Strength/Defense can be adapted to your playstyle / sweet spot             |
| Poleaxe      | Strength            | Defense             | The weight of Strength/Defense can be adapted to your playstyle / sweet spot             |
| Maul         | Defense             | Strength            | You already make a lot of DMG as Maul, so you should favour putting more points into DEF |
| Musket       | Strength or Agility | -                   | STR Musket for max bomb damage (PVE), AGI for PVP (piercing damage)                      |
